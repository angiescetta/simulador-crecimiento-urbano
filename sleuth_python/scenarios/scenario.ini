# Each model run may be completed in a monte carlo fashion.
#  For CALIBRATION or TEST mode measurements of simulated data will be
#  taken for years of known data, and averaged over the number of monte
#  carlo iterations. These averages are written to the AVG_FILE, and
#  the associated standard diviation is written to the STD_DEV_FILE.
#  The averaged values are compared to the known data, and a Pearson
#  correlation coefficient measure is calculated and written to the
#  control_stats.log file. The input per run may be associated across
#  files using the 'index' number in the files' first column.

# COEFFICIENTS AND GROWTH TYPES
#     DIFFUSION: affects SPONTANEOUS GROWTH and search distance along the
#                road network as part of ROAD INFLUENCED GROWTH.
#     BREED: NEW SPREADING CENTER probability and affects number of ROAD
#            INFLUENCED GROWTH attempts.
#     SPREAD: the probabilty of ORGANIC GROWTH from established urban
#             pixels occuring.
#     SLOPE_RESISTANCE: affects the influence of slope to urbanization. As
#                       value increases, the ability to urbanize
#                       ever steepening slopes decreases.
#     ROAD_GRAVITY: affects the outward distance from a selected pixel for
#                   which a road pixel will be searched for as part of
#                   ROAD INFLUENCED GROWTH.
