def slope_weight(slope, slp_res, critical_slp):
    """Calculate slope resistance weights.

    Calculates the slope resistance for slope values. The slope
    resistance is a monotonous increasing function of slope boundend in 0-1
    which specific shape is controlled by slp_res coefficient and the
    slope critical value.

    It is interpreted as the probability of resisting urbanization due to
    a steep slope.

    The function is:

    min(1, 1 - (crit_slp - slp)/crit_slp ** 2(slp_res/MAX_SLP_RES))

    Note: The max exponent is 2, which bounds the growth rate of
    rejection probability. A more generall sigmoid function may be
    useful here. Another advantage of a more general sigmoid is that
    the effect of the critical cutoff can be handled by a shape parameter,
    which is differentiable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    slope : float or np.array
        Slope values for which to calculate resistance.
    slp_res : float
        Coefficient governing the shape of the resistance function.
    critical_slp : float
        Critical slope value above which all weights are one.

    Returns
    -------
    slope_w: np.array
        1D array of slope weights.
